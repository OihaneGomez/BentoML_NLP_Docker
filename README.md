This project contains a **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** API built with **BentoML** and deployed via **Docker**. It uses a combination of **BM25** and **semantic search (BGE embeddings)** to find the most relevant transport processes based on a questionnaire.

## Quickstart

  

### 1. Clone the Repository

  

```bash

git clone https://github.com/OihaneGomez/BentoML_NLP_Docker/

cd BentoML_NLP

  ```

### 2. Build and start the container
```bash
docker-compose up  --build
  ```
  

  
# API Endpoint
Once the container is running, navigate to port 3000. For instace: http://localhost:3000 
You will see the **BentoML Swagger UI**, which documents the available endpoints:

### POST `/search_processes`

- **Input**: JSON array of questions and answers in the format `"Question : Answer"`
- **Output**: A ranked list of transport processes with their relevance scores

## Example Input

```json
[
  "In which location is this transport process taking place? : Location GLO",
  "If external road transport is used, what type of energy does the vehicle use? : Gasoline gas",
  "If you use road transport, what type of vehicle do you use? : TRUCK LORRY",
  "What is the maximum authorized weight of the vehicle? (ton) : 3.5-7.5",
  "According to the EURO classification of transport vehicles, to which group does your vehicle belong? : EURO3 EU3",
  "Do you use a container? : Container",
  "Select the type of container you use for road transport: Cooling",
  "If refrigeration equipment is used, select the refrigerant used: refrigeration R134a"
]
```
## Example Output
